# iitbazaar
This is my devclub submission...\
IIT Bazaar is supposed to connect buyers and seller on campus by removing the middle man and directly connecting them using a clean and beautiful user interface.\
\
In my submission i've focused on the backend problem statement but also added a simple elegant front end.\

I'm adding a ui folder in the images (img) folder in which static screenshots and a short clip of the site functioning (walkthrough) can be viewed.\
\
The website is up and running on www.aryangupta.xyz/IITBazaar \
However due to the messed up hosting it is running terrible slow.\
To run the site on your location computer, download a php client such as XAMPP or WAMP for windows or MAMP for mac. \
Then in phpmyadmin, run the sql query in the sql.txt file to create the datebase for the website. \
Clone the repo and transfer it to the htdocs (or sometimes www) folder of the php client. \
Finnaly, go to the core folder of this site, then open the dbconnect.php file. \
