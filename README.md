# iitbazaar
This is my devclub submission...
IIT Bazaar is supposed to connect buyers and seller on campus by removing the middle man and directly connecting them using a clean and beautiful user interface.
In my submission i've focused on the backend problem statement but also added a simple elegant front end.
NOTE: While uploading listing, only upload images in jpg format.................
All the code is complete to most extent, but it is not hosted anywhere so i will try to host it on my own domain before the 13th along with a special login for the admin account which will also be listed here.
Please do check back here on the 13th for an updated readme file.
The design document and research document will be available here shortly :
