# iitbazaar
This is my devclub submission...\
IIT Bazaar is supposed to connect buyers and seller on campus by removing the middle man and directly connecting them using a clean and beautiful user interface.\
\
In my submission i've focused on the backend problem statement but also added a simple elegant front end.\

\
I'm adding a ui folder in the images (img) folder in which static screenshots and a short clip of the site functioning (walkthrough) can be viewed.\
\
The website is up and running on www.aryangupta.xyz/IITBazaar \
However due to the messed up hosting it is running terrible slow.\
1) To run the site on your location computer, download a php client such as XAMPP or WAMP for windows or MAMP for mac. \
2) Then in phpmyadmin, run the sql query in the sql.txt file to create the datebase for the website. \
3) Clone the repo and transfer it to the htdocs (or sometimes www) folder of the php client. \
4) Finnaly, go to the folder named core of this site, then open the dbconnect.php file. \
In the dbconnect.php, change the username and password which is given as ('root','root') to the username and password of your phpmyadmin => ('username','password');\
For optimum results, run the website on chrome  

****Login details for IITBazaar****
I have created 5 users and an admin and 5 demo listings.  
For user number i, the email is: useri@iitd.ac.in  
And the corresponding password would be: useri  
Example: For user number 3 => email: user3@iitd.ac.in and password: user3 \
The admin login => email: admin@iitd.ac.in and password: admin \
The admin is current capable of blocking/unblocking active listings, and can delete any active listing on the website.\
